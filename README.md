## **cofi** â€” corruption finder

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6778kw234wjcaf9p?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/yandexx/cofi)

This is a simple tool that is designed to determine whether any data gets corrupted during I/O to a file.

It generates random data blocks, calculates md5 for them, writes them to a target file, afterwards reads the data back and compares md5 hashes. This procedure repeats forever until stopped manually, or until corruption gets detected.

The tool was used successfully in a production case to prove that corruption was happening.

* On Windows the WinAPI `FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING` flag is used, to disallow any caching on the OS level, and additionally `FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH` during the writing stage.
* On Linux: `O_SYNC` and `O_DSYNC` flags during writing.
